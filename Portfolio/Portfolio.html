  <p> Things, Things and Stuff, not sure exactly what to write here but I'm going to fill it up with text so I can check the bounding box of the image and make sure that the text wrap functions properly with the float: left; property in place.  Like before, I'm using the image of Holy Order Sol Badguy from the fighting game, Guilty Gear as a placeholder, as I assume that this image and text will be filled in later with personal information when it comes time to submit this for real job interviews.  Anywho, Holy Order Sol's main character gimmick / mechanic is his secondary charge gauge, which builds meter upon charging or charge cancelling his special moves.  His specials are typically weaker than his regular counterpart but upon reaching level 2 or 3, his moves do a devestating amount of damage and gain special properties such as hard knockdown or wall splat, which can in turn lead to even more damage.  He also has the ability to mini-burst during his charge state, keeping you safe to a small degree and can push opponents back if timed properly.</p>
  <p>
  	When he does his super moves is when the charge gauge really starts to matter as it change the damage as well as the animation depending on the gauge used.  For example, his Tyrant Rave Type Alpha at level 1 charge produces a small explosion where his sword/boulder hits the ground.  his T.R. at level 2 produces 3 of those explosions in a row, towards the opponent, which have the ability to hit multiple times.  His level 3 is the craziest as it creates a huge, repeat, huge explosion that does about a 1/3 of a characters health in damage and takes up about half of the screen.  If it is a counter hit, it eats up 1/2 of the opponent's life and leaves them staggered, allowing you to run up and continue into a combo.  Resource management is very important to this character, making him hard to master but his toolset and his damage potential make it all completely worth it and I hope his appearance in the latest Guilty Gear is very soon.
