	This image is not really me but I don't want to take a picture and I don't have any on me at the moment, so Sol Badguy is going to have to do.  I already know a fair amount of HTML and CSS so something like this is pretty basic, but I would be interested to try it in that weird language that was shown in class (that for the life of me, I can't remember its name).  If you're wondering where the guy from the profile image is from, it's <a href="http://guiltygear.us/ggxrdr/" target="_blank">Guilty Gear</a>.
